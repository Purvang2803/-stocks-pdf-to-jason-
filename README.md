## ðŸ›  How It Works

Each broker's contract note has its own layout. This script uses `pdfplumber` to extract text and regular expressions to match and parse trade data fields.

Parsed data includes:
- Trade Date
- Trade Time
- Trade No
- Security / Contract Description
- Buy/Sell Indicator
- Quantity
- Price per Unit
- Net Total
